# Introducing Dev Cockpit: Your Ultimate macOS Developer Toolkit

After months of development and testing, we're thrilled to announce the official launch of Dev Cockpit - a revolutionary system monitoring and development toolkit designed exclusively for Apple Silicon Macs.

## Why We Built Dev Cockpit

As developers ourselves, we were frustrated with the fragmented landscape of macOS development tools. We found ourselves constantly switching between multiple applications to:
- Monitor system performance
- Manage Homebrew packages
- Track Docker containers
- Debug network issues
- Analyze Git repositories

Each tool had its own interface, its own learning curve, and most importantly, none were optimized for Apple Silicon's incredible capabilities.

## Built for Apple Silicon, Built for Privacy

Dev Cockpit is a 100% native macOS application built with SwiftUI. This means:
- **Blazing Fast Performance**: Leverages Apple Silicon's efficiency
- **Minimal Resource Usage**: Uses less than 50MB of memory
- **Complete Privacy**: All data stays on your Mac - no telemetry, no cloud uploads

## Key Features at Launch

### üç∫ Homebrew Management
Visual package browser with dependency tracking, one-click updates, and bulk operations. See your entire Homebrew ecosystem at a glance.

### üê≥ Docker Dashboard

### üìä System Performance Monitor
Track CPU usage per core, memory pressure, disk I/O, network traffic, GPU performance, and thermal states - all in beautiful, real-time charts.

### üîç Network Tools
